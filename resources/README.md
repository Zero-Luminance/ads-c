## Description:
Learning algorithms & data structures can be a stressful & difficult process. However, there exists tools which can help save time & (maybe) tears during one's learning journey.

[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is a low-level programming language that is not beginner friendly relative to other modern programming languages such as [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) or [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). ***'Low-Level Programming'*** in the case of C, refers to it's lack of an automatic memory management system where users have to be cognizant of topics such as 'pointers', 'addresses', dynamic (heap) memory, etc. The '[concepts-in-c](https://github.com/Zero-Luminance/ads-c/tree/main/resources/concepts-in-c)' directory may be useful for the aforementioned topics.

Upon selecting & having learned a programming language there are other tools (see the '[software-tools](https://github.com/Zero-Luminance/ads-c/tree/main/resources/software-tools)' directory) that can be used to save time when writing & managing code which include:
- [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git): Version control software documentation by Atlassian
- [GDB (GNU Project Debugger)](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/): A popular debugging tool for C/C++
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): For efficient compilation of C/C++ files
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html): Is a documenting software with a set of guidelines for various programming languages

# ALGORITHMS & DATA STUCTURES (ADS)

## Description:
This repository contains [notes](), [resources](), & implementations of algorithms & data structures in the ***C programming language***. The notes are largely derived from [The University Of Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Melbourne)'s 2022 [Design Of Algorithms (COMP20007)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp20007) & [Algorithms & Data Structures (COMP20003)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp20003) subjects which uses Steven S. Skiena's '[The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/)' as a textbook.
